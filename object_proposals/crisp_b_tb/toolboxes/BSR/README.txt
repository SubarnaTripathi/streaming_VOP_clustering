Code provided in this folder is a subset of the Berkeley segmentation code (BSR: http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/resources.html). Some files have been slightly modified for use with crisp boundaries.

Code in “gpb_src” is the version of the gpb source code provided by MCG (http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/CS/vision/grouping/mcg/). Some small modifications were made to fix compilation errors.

Code in “custom code for crisp boundaries” is BSR and MCG code modified for crisp boundaries. Code credit is given at the top of each file.
