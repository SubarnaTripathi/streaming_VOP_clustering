The issues below only affect UCM segmentation. You can still do boundary detection (“findBoundaries”) even if you were unable to compile the UCM part of the code.



WINDOWS

UCM segmentation is not supported on Windows. But please email me if you figure out a way to compile UCM on Windows (phillipi@mit.edu).


LINUX

If you get an error like "Invalid MEX-file 'path/to/ucm_mean_pb.mexa64': /matlab's/path/to/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.15' not found", then probably you have the issue explained here: http://www.mlpack.org/trac/ticket/253

You can avoid this issue by compiling with a Matlab supported compiler (Matlab issues a warning if you did not use a supported compiler).

Alternatively, you may be able to resolve this issue by invoking Matlab with "LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/libstdc++.so.6 matlab". Replace the "/path/to/" with the path to your system's install location for libstdc++.
